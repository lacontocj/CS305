Module 8 Portfolio

1. The client, Artemis Financial, wanted us to address any existing security vulnerabilities in their financial application. We conducted a security assessment and addressed all pre-existing security flaws in the application.
2. When our static vulnerability check reported many out of date dependencies, we updated all of them. After performing updates on the vulnerable dependencies, we performed a second static vulnerability scan. The resulting scan showed no more vulnerabilities. It's always important to code securely, but it is even more important in a financial application. It is crucial to protect sensitive user data. When a company has secure code, they can save time and money by avoiding easy to fix exploited security flaws.
3. I found that I didn't have much difficulty with the security assessment, but I had trouble with adapting the program to be secure while using Java 8. I found it helpful to learn the basics of using Spring Boot, because that is a practical framework used in many real applications, but I would have liked to work with newer and more current versions of this.
4. I increased security by updating vulnerable dependencies, and I added checksum verification to the application. In the future, I would continue to use Maven to address static vulnerabilities, but I would also incorperate some form of dynamic vulnerability detection while the application is live.
5. I made sure that the code was functional and secure by running it and testing it during each iteration of my refactoring. After making sure everything ran properly, I used Maven to run another static vulnerability check to ensure I didn't introduce any new vulnerabilities.
6. In the future, I would utilize Maven to run dependency checks. I would also utilize the Java docs database to ensure I learned the correct syntax.
7. For this assignment, I would show that I understand the basic concepts of implementing cryptographic ciphers with Spring Boot. I think this project shows that I have a basic understanding of secure coding practices.
